Introduction\nI\nn January 2015, the Government of India\u2019s Central Statistics Office \n(CSO) introduced a new series of National Accounts Statistics (NAS) \nwith base year 2011\u201312, replacing the earlier series with base year 2004\u201305 \n(CSO 2015a).1 This is a routine matter for the CSO\u2014as with the statistical \noffices of most countries\u2014to change the base year of the NAS periodically \nto account for structural changes in the economy and in relative prices and \nto replace older survey data with newer surveys that better capture current \neconomic activity.2 This time around, the revision also had another objec-\ntive: to update to the extent possible the underlying methodology of NAS to \nthe most recent international guidelines, namely the UN System of National \nAccounts 2008 (SNA 2008).3\nIn changing the methodology and data sources for the new series, the \nCSO said:\nBesides shifting the base year from 2004\u201305 to 2011\u201312, this series incorporates latest \navailable data from surveys, censuses, new economic activities, expansion of coverage \nof activities and improvement in procedures, and to the extent possible, the latest recom-\nmendations of System of National Accounts (SNA) 2008 in the compilation of national \naccounts. (CSO 2015b, Foreword)\nCSO held a \u201cData User Conference\u201d in 2015 on the new series, and slides \nof the presentation at this conference (CSO 2015c) have been in circula-\ntion, though not officially as a CSO paper. In addition, there has been \nextensive discussion in the media, as well as in professional journals by \n1. See the website of the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI) \nhttp://mospi.gov.in/publication/documents-report-sub-committee-national-income-0 for a \nnumber of reports of the government\u2019s Sub-committee on National Income and background \nstudies relating to the new series. A good reference for the previous revision of the NAS to \nbase year 2004\u201305 done in 2010 is available in CSO (2010).\n2. Professor P. C. Mahalanobis, chairman of the First National Income Committee, was \ninstrumental in the founding of CSO. He also founded the National Sample Survey (NSS) \nin the Indian Statistical Institute at Kolkata, later transferred to the central government and \ncalled the National Sample Survey Organization.

Critically reviewing and summarizing this large and \ndiverse literature is beyond the scope of this paper. What we do instead \nis to draw on this literature selectively while including all the important \nCSO publications in our assessment of the new NAS series and the major \ncontroversies surrounding it.\nSection 2 of CSO (2015b), entitled \u201cGuiding Principles for the New \nSeries,\u201d lists the three major components influencing the present revision \nexercise as:\n(i) revision of base year to a most recent year (for meaningful analysis of structural \nchanges in the economy in real terms); (ii) complete review of the existing database and \nmethodology employed in the estimation of various macroeconomic aggregates, including \nthe choice of alternative databases on individual subjects; and (iii) to the extent feasible, \nimplementing the international guidelines on the compilation of national accounts, the \nSystem of National Accounts, 2008\u2026. (CSO 2015b, p. 3). \nThe first two components are almost routinely undertaken during any revi-\nsion of the base year. Whether or not the second component was in fact a \n\u201ccomplete\u201d review will depend on the extent of structural changes in the \nIndian economy that must be incorporated, the new data that had become \navailable since the previous base year, and the time and resources CSO \ndevoted to the task. \nThe structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2  describes the main \nchanges made in the new series, and compares them to the old series, par-\nticularly those that are at the heart of the ongoing debate. Before coming to \nthe current debate, it is important to point out that there have been many, \nlong-standing methodological issues that have beset the Indian NAS, which, \nstrictly speaking, does not follow the global SNA templates. Only some of \nthese long-standing issues were addressed in the recent revision. We believe \nthat many of these issues warrant flagging in any methodological review \nof the NAS. Section 3, therefore, describes the legacy issues relating to the \nmethodologies followed in the revised series. \nSection 4 describes the principal methodological changes made in the \nrevision that seem to have affected the rates of output growth and how they \nmight relate to the structure of the economy. While the methodological \nchanges in the new series are substantive and extensive, this review will \nfocus on the main issues that have come up for scrutiny in the public debate \nand not address all the changes made.

Section 5 explores our individual concerns on the problems \nconfronting the old and new NAS series. Section 6 concludes by making \nseveral recommendations.\n2. Changes in the New National Account Statistics\nFor India, with its overwhelming majority of the labor force unorganized \nand informal (as measured by the NSS in its quinquennial employment and \nunemployment surveys [EUS]), and with the uneven quality of economic \ndata used in the estimation of the NAS, a base year revision is usually \nan occasion to improve methodologies, bring in newer and better data-\nbases, and address long recognized infirmities in the national accounts.4\nUntil the latest revision, the rebasing has usually led to a marginal rise \nin the absolute size of the aggregate measures as economic activities \nget better represented. However, their annual growth rates invariably \ndid not change\u2014implying that though the absolute size of the economy \nmay have altered slightly in the new base year, its rate of growth had \nremained the same.\nThe recent revision has been different. The absolute size of India\u2019s gross \nvalue added (GVA) at current basic prices in the 2011\u201312 base year was \nmarginally \u201csmaller\u201d by 2.1 percent compared to the earlier gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) estimates at current factor costs, and there was a significant \nchange in the growth rates for the subsequent years. For instance, India\u2019s \nannual economic growth rate for 2013\u201314 at constant base prices according \nto the new series was 6.2 percent, compared to 4.8 percent at constant factor \ncost according to the old series (Figure 1). Further, the manufacturing sec-\ntor GVA\u2019s growth rate in real terms for the same year changed from \u20130.7 \npercent to +5.3 percent. Furthermore, the revised estimates did not seem \nconsistent with other macroeconomic indicators such as corporate earnings \nor credit growth (Figures 2a and 2b).\nSimilarly, rates of domestic saving and investment as a percentage of \ngross domestic disposable income were also much higher in the new series \n4. The definitions of the terms \u201corganized\u201d and \u201cunorganized,\u201d \u201cestablishment,\u201d and \n\u201centerprise\u201d depend on data sources, such as the population and economic censuses, follow-\nup enterprise surveys and, of course, the NSS Employment and Unemployment Surveys. \nThe comparability of data across sources and over time cannot be taken for granted since the \ndefinitions of the concepts used in the surveys also seem to vary across surveys.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2516, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "73a25167-724d-4af5-a6ee-11107eeaca09": {"__data__": {"id_": "73a25167-724d-4af5-a6ee-11107eeaca09", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "b1-1.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\vinayak\\Downloads\\QA_based_on_pdf\\Data\\b1-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 634896, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d219eb7f-4d71-4739-9c5b-461ee5305e34", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "b1-1.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\vinayak\\Downloads\\QA_based_on_pdf\\Data\\b1-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 634896, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "5eaa5fa58882189f8960c36469ae594681452b1fcd66f05ba363481062d765b9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "R.

But \nthe debate has refused to go away, and the doubts seem to get reinforced \nwith every release of the new estimates.6\n2.1. Changes in the Sectoral Composition of Domestic Output\nTo begin with, it is useful to list the principal changes in the domestic output \nestimates at current prices in the new series. The main changes are the following:\n1. The industrial (also referred to in this paper as sectoral) composition \nof domestic output has changed somewhat: the industrial sector\u2019s size \nat market prices has swelled by about 5 percent of GDP in the new \nseries, with a corresponding decline in the tertiary sector\u2019s size and \nthe share of agriculture remaining broadly the same (Table 2). \nFIGURE 3.

For instance, in first week of June 2016, just ahead of the IPF Conference, there were two \nop-ed columns critical of the new estimates, which showed that the high and rising growth rate \nis made up of unexplainable \u201cdiscrepancies\u201d and accounted for nearly half of the incremental \noutput growth in the January\u2013March 2016 quarter.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2094, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "58c7cab5-95f7-4784-9629-de55e960601b": {"__data__": {"id_": "58c7cab5-95f7-4784-9629-de55e960601b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "b1-1.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\vinayak\\Downloads\\QA_based_on_pdf\\Data\\b1-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 634896, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "df2d168e-7bd6-48b9-9efb-1a4ce891cbef", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "b1-1.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\vinayak\\Downloads\\QA_based_on_pdf\\Data\\b1-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 634896, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "111648f1c72f0398b9815ead5a6f86c61752612bcf7f48b577c06e138ee93e1b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "80 INDIA POLICY FORUM, 20 16\u201317\n2.

It shows that the shares \nof manufacturing and the financial sector have expanded, while those \nof trade, hotels, and restaurants, and of community, social, and public \nservices have declined.\n2.2. Changes in the Institutional Composition of GDP\nThere have been important shifts in the institutional composition of GDP \n(Figure 4). The new series uses the corporate form of organization in four \nout of six institutional sectors. The two excluded are general government and \nthe household sector. This change could have implications for the measure-\nment of output in many activities, as discussed below.\n2.3. Changes in the Organizational Units of Measurement\nIn the old series, a factory or a plant was the unit of record. In any plant, \nactivities could include the production of goods and services, the latter \nincluding the management of the plant (and possibly also of other plants of \nthe same owner) and auditing, and accounting services for that plant (and \npossibly for other plants owned by the same owner). Therefore, unless \nthe owner owned only one plant, the traditional statements of assets and \nliabilities, and of income and expenditure for the plant would have been \nmeaningless in the old series. \nTABLE 2.

As a result, the size of PCS has gone up by 11 \npercentage points of GDP, with a corresponding reduction in the size of \nthe household sector. As is widely known, PCS consists of NF-PCS and \nfinancial PCS (F-PCS). In the new NAS, the larger size of PCS seems to \nbe on account of NF-PCS, while the F-PCS\u2019 size has remained the same.\nCorrespondingly, the GVA of the household sector has contracted. \nThere could, however, be another possible reason for the shrinkage of \nthe household sector: the methodology for estimating GDP in the nona-\ngricultural household sector has changed (CSO 2015e; more about this \nin Section 4).  \n2.4. Changes in the Estimation of Manufacturing Output \nA lot of the debate on the new NAS has centered around the manufacturing \nsector.7 The manufacturing sector has traditionally been measured in two \nparts. First, the registered sector, consisting of all factories registered under \nthe Factories Act\u2014that is, factories employing 10 or more workers using \npower (or 20 or more workers without power)\u2014accounting for about two-\nthirds of manufacturing sector output and employing about 20 percent of \nmanufacturing employment. The Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) is the \nprincipal database to capture the output of registered manufacturing. ASI, \nin turn, consists of two parts: an annual census of all registered factories \nemploying 50 or more workers using power (or 100 or more workers without \npower) and a sample survey of smaller registered factories, with roughly \none-third of such factories surveyed each year. \nSecond, the rest of the manufacturing sector\u2014small workshops and \nhousehold enterprises employing less than 10 workers with power (or \n20 workers without power) and called unregistered or unorganized \n7.

Further, \nthere is a problem of nonresponse by factories that do not comply with the \nlaw to submit their production information under the ASI. \nThe foregoing method of measuring manufacturing output has many \nshortcomings: first, there is about a two-year lag in getting ASI results, dur-\ning which the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) was used for estimating \nmanufacturing sector GVA. Second, the IIP\u2019s quality has been deteriorating \nover time, adversely affecting the quality of value added estimates in manu-\nfacturing. Third, the estimation of the unorganized manufacturing sector\u2019s \noutput was widely considered unsatisfactory, as the value added per worker \n(VAPW) parameter that was being used tended to get outdated, leading to \nthe underestimation of its output.\nThe new NAS series has largely done away with the ASI, replacing it with \ncorporate sector data called the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) 21 \ndatabase and accounting for nearly two-thirds of manufacturing value added \n(Tables 4a and 4b). As mentioned earlier, partnership and proprietary firms in \nunregistered manufacturing that use books of accounts (as per the NSS survey \ndata) are now defined as QCs and shifted to PCS. Their growth rate is taken \nto be the same as that of the manufacturing sector in PCS in the new series. \n2.5. Shrinkage of the Household Sector 8\nAs shown earlier, for 2011\u201312, the household sector\u2019s share of GDP has \nfallen from 54 percent in the old series to 43 percent in the new series \nmainly for two reasons: first, QCs have been moved to PCS, and second, \nTABLE 4a.

The CSO explains this process as follows:\n2.2 At present, the estimates of value added and related macroeconomic aggregates \nfor a number of economic activities carried out in the unorganized segment of the \neconomy are compiled using an indirect method called the Labor Input Method (LIM). \nIn this method, first the labor input (LI) is compiled as the sum of workers, either \non the principal status or on the subsidiary status (including the work on subsidiary \nstatus of principal status workers), at detailed activity level known as \u201ccompilation \ncategories\u201d (CCs).\n2.3 The CCs are determined by regrouping the economic activities at 3, 4, and 5 digit \nlevel described in the National Industrial Classification (NIC), which, in turn, follows \nthe International Standards Industrial Classification (ISIC) of All Economic Activities \nof the United Nations. As per the recommendations of the Advisory Committee, the \nsame CCs of 1999\u20132000 series based on NIC 1998 were used for the current series \n(2004\u201305 =100) because of marginal changes in NIC 2004.\n2.4 The benchmark GVA estimates of the unorganized manufacturing and services \nsectors are then prepared for the CCs for the base year of national accounts series using \nthe estimated labor input (LI) engaged and the VAPW in the activity.\n2.5 The base year estimates are projected to subsequent years ...

Gross Saving and Capital Formation Estimates\nThe new series has published a gross national saving and capital formation \nseries, in place of a gross domestic saving (GDS) and capital formation \nseries, signifying the growing role of the external sector in the economy. \nThus, in place of the concepts of GDP, GDS, and gross domestic invest-\nment, the corresponding gross national product concepts are used. The \nrelevant income concept includes net factor income and transfers from \nabroad. Further, for the first time, saving is reported more meaningfully \nin an economic sense as a proportion of gross national disposable income \n(GNDI), rather than the earlier measure of a gross saving to GDP ratio. \nSimilarly, expenditure on valuables, which was once treated as consump-\ntion expenditure, was separately recorded in the old series as one of the \nassets in the standard table on \u201cGross Capital Formation by Institutions \nand Asset Class,\u201d but without indicating which institution owned it and \ntheir ownership shares (Rajakumar, Sawant, and Shetty 2015; Srinivasan \n2014).10 In the new series, the entire ownership of valuables has been \nassigned to the household sector. But CSO has not indicated how the \nhousehold sector finances this investment, thereby making a consistent, \nconsolidated account of the national capital and finance accounts difficult \nto estimate (more about this in Section 3). \n2.7.

Legacy Issues14\n3.1. Approaches to the Measurement of Gross Domestic Product\nThe task of putting together the NAS in an emerging market country such as \nIndia is a continuing activity. As the economy develops, it has to respond, \nas it must, to the dynamics of development at home and abroad, opportunities \nfrom a shifting global technology frontier, and from demographic changes, \nand more methodologically, to advances in economic and statistical theories, \neconomic measurement and econometrics, and computational capabilities \nand techniques. This being the case, at any point in time, there will invariably \nbe a legacy of unfinished tasks and known, but yet to be availed, opportuni-\nties, and importantly, anticipated opportunities likely to be available in the \nnear future. This makes any description of legacy issues difficult, imprecise, \nuncertain, and subjective, if not entirely arbitrary. Also some of the tasks \ndescribed in this section as unfinished legacy are as relevant for the new \nseries of NAS as they would have been for the old series. For this reason, \n11. Two tables in CSO (2015b) provide data on institutional-cum-industrial classification \nof output. Table 2 on page 19 gives data on \u201cGVA for non-financial PCS excluding quasi \ncorporate sector in 2011\u201312;\u201d Annexure I on page A-1 gives data on \u201cGVA at basic prices for \nthe year 2011\u201312 by industry and institutional sector.\u201d The difference in the estimates for PCS \nbetween the two tables is on account of QCs. This is the evidence to show that in the official \nstatistics, QCs are defined as part of NF-PCS. But the information given in the text above \nshows that unorganized financial enterprises are also included in QCs. Therefore, the arguments \nwe raised in Nagaraj (2015d) and in our rejoinder to CSO (Nagaraj 2015e) merit attention. We \ngratefully owe this clarification to Rymond Zhong. \n12. This is estimated using the industry by institutions GVA table in Annexure\u2013I, page \nA-1, and GVA for NF-PCS excluding QCs from Table 2, page 19 (CSO 2015b).\n13. This hunch is based on the following reason. As a large part of QCs is unregistered \nmanufacturing, which accounts for about 4\u20135 percent of GDP, QCs in services are likely \nto have much smaller VA per worker. Further, following the methodological reasoning in \n\u201cMystery of Private Corporate Saving,\u201d Subba Rao (2015) suggests that QC size is perhaps \noverstated in the new NAS.\n14.

If we ignore for simplicity the complications arising from \ndirect and indirect taxes, except for measurement errors, the three approaches \nshould lead to the same estimate of GDP.

Yet from Table 6.1 of CSO (2015b), which \nlists items/sectors for which either a production or income approach is being \nused, even with the changes in methodology and data sources in the new \nseries, no significant dent seems to have been made in this mishmash legacy.\n3.2.

It \nalso includes unincorporated enterprises and partnerships. Not only in the \nCES but in almost all household surveys of the NSS, such as the EUS, the \nconventional \u201ckitchen\u201d definition for households is used.\nIn the CES, data only on consumption (quantities and values) are col-\nlected from the sampled households.

Moreover, the NSS \nEUS show that a significant number of labor force participants from con-\nventional households are self-employed, so that their income is a mixture of \noperating surpluses from their production activity in agricultural, cottage, \nor village industry in which they are self-employed, and wage income from \ntheir supply of labor. \nWithout data on household income, clearly household saving cannot be \nderived from the CES. In fact, only limited use is made in the NAS (old and \nnew) of the commodity pattern of consumption expenditure from the CES, \nand instead Table 3 commodity-flow approach is used.15 Importantly, the \nasset composition of GCF is derived by using the commodity-flow method. \nAlso, some of the durables purchased by households could be dual use, \nin that their services could be consumed as well as used as intermediate \ninputs in home production and/or other income-earning activities. Data on \nhousehold purchases of financial instruments are not available in the CES. \nThis means that consistent data on income, saving, and investment, and its \nfinancing by households, as conventionally defined, are not available from \nthe CES.

Whether such a \nsurvey will be extended to urban areas and continued is not known. \nIt is worth recognizing that the legacy of not having data collected from \ndirect responses of households on a mutually consistent basis on consump-\ntion, saving, and investment necessarily means the NAS estimates of PFCE, \n15.

The \nissue is discussed in more detail in Section 5. \n3.3. Outsourcing, Fragmentation of Production, Regional, and  \nGlobal Value Chains\nAlthough strictly speaking this is not a legacy issue, newer forms of produc-\ntion could have significant implication for the new NAS series. With the \nWTO\u2019s GATS agreement on services trade in 2001, service activities that \nused to be done within a manufacturing company are being outsourced to \nspecialized service companies within a country or in a foreign country, so \nthat the value that used to be added by service employees of the manufactur-\ning company is now being outsourced to service companies. This process, \noriginally described by Jagdish Bhagwati, is now very extensive, leading to \ngrowing international trade in components and parts and in what is called \nprocess trade, in which goods are shipped back and forth among countries \nfor completion of all processes before the goods are ready. Although the \nquantitative significance for India of the growth of global value chains \nover the last two decades is not known, what is known is that India is a \nlatecomer in its participation in such chains. Such an analysis should begin \nas soon as possible. Unfortunately, the MCA 21 database is fairly recent \nand makes a reliable retrospective analysis difficult. However, as a start, \nCSO should begin publishing India\u2019s international trade data in gross and \nnet value added terms.\n3.4. Error Estimates for Sectoral and Aggregate Value Added\nThe first and final reports of the First National Income Committee, chaired by \nthe late Professor P. C. Mahalanobis, provided approximate error estimates \nfor aggregate and sectoral value added. Although these were not sampling \nerrors in a statistical sense, they were very informative. The CSO does not \nprovide similar error estimates, so that it is impossible to tell whether NAS \nestimates are now less error prone after more than six decades. On the prin-\nciple of better late than never, CSO should start publishing error estimates \nas soon as possible.\n3.5.

The Ongoing Debate17\nThis section deals with the methodological changes made in the new NAS \nseries and the main debates surrounding the new estimates that ensued.

For the sake of convenience, \nthe term \u201cGDP\u201d denotes GVA at basic prices in the new series and GDP at \nfactor cost in the old series. \n4.1. The Private Corporate Sector\nHistorically, due to poor enforcement of the law, only a small fraction of \nregistered companies filed their audited balance sheets with the Registrar of \nCompanies (Nagaraj 2015d).18 However, as all large companies (that is, with \nhigh paid-up capital [PUC]) mostly filed their balance sheets, and PCS was \nthen a small part of the economy, RBI\u2019s small sample of companies with high \nPUC was deemed adequate to capture the PCS\u2019 saving and capital formation.19\nRBI sample estimates were then \u201cblown up\u201d to the universe of registered \ncompanies\u2014using PUC as the parameter\u2014to get estimates for PCS.\nHowever, with the phenomenal growth in company registrations during \nthe last three decades, and with the majority of them not complying with \nthe statutory requirement to file a return, the foregoing method has become \nunreliable as there is no record of the universe of \u201cworking\u201d companies. The \n2001 National Statistical Commission Report had clearly stated this fact and \nrecommended conducting a census of working companies at least once in a \ndecade to ascertain the universe of working companies. To quote the report: \nThere are more than five lakh (500,000) companies registered in the Registrar of \nCompanies, but the actual number of companies that are operating is not known. This \nsituation seriously affects the reliability of various estimates. An exercise conducted in \n17. This section largely reflects R. Nagaraj\u2019s views.\n18.

Disaggregating the growth shows \nthat GDP in the PCS was the source of rapid growth. Inquiring into the pos-\nsible overestimation of services output growth, Nagaraj (2009) had found a \nsubstantial rise in the share of PCS in GDP using estimates derived indirectly \nfrom the NAS. Comparing these estimates with those obtained using Centre \nfor Monitoring Indian Economy Pvt. Ltd (CMIE)\u2019s Prowess database, we \nhad shown that there seems to be a systematic overestimation of PCS output \nin GDP (Figure 5). For instance, for 2005\u201306 the share of PCS in GDP as \nper NAS was about 18 percent, whereas it was just about 8 percent based \non the CMIE data. Even assuming that the CMIE data underestimates the \nsize of the PCS since it ignores small private limited companies, the gap \nbetween the two estimates is so wide that it clearly points to overestimation \nin the NAS.20\nIn about 2006, MCA initiated an effort to encourage companies to file \ntheir financial returns electronically and created a web portal where compa-\nnies could e-file their returns.

In other words, in spite of its best efforts, the regulatory \nauthority could at best get little over one-half of registered companies to \ncomply with the mandatory requirement. With the phenomenal growth in \ncompany registration in the last two decades, a growing proportion of the \nnewer companies seem to be bogus/fictitious, thus seriously eroding cred-\nibility and validity problems with the MCA 21 database (Nagaraj 2015d).\nCSO\u2019s decision to use the MCA 21 database to directly estimate national \nincome aggregates for NF-PCS for the new NAS series was widely wel-\ncomed at that time. The new NAS showed that the PCS accounted for \nabout 35 percent of GDP in 2011\u201312, significantly larger than its previous, \nindirectly estimated size. The growth rate of the PCS also turned out to be \nhigher. And since a large part of manufacturing firms belonged to the PCS, \nmanufacturing\u2019s share in GDP also increased. Both changes led to skepti-\ncism about the veracity of the new estimates and have been at the center of \nthe debate between the CSO and the NAS-user community. \nThere are two methodological changes introduced by CSO that are key \nto the debate, as revealed when the reliability of the PCS estimates has been \nquestioned (Nagaraj 2015a, 2015b). These are, first, the \u201cblow-up\u201d factor, \nand second, the inconsistency between the aggregated and the disaggregated \ncost data that seem to have yielded widely differing GVA estimates. \nPut simply, since the number of companies for which accounts are \navailable varies from year to year, the \u201cblowing-up\u201d or \u201cscaling-up\u201d fac-\ntor changes correspondingly, thus greatly affecting the final estimates. To \nillustrate, for the years 2011\u201312 and 2012\u201313, the MCA 21 database con-\nsisted of about 500,000 companies. Estimates based on the PUC of these \ncompanies were \u201cblown up\u201d to about 900,000 \u201cactive companies.\u201d However, \nfor 2013\u201314, the number of companies in the MCA database submitting \ntheir financials plummeted to about 300,000. When the estimates based on \nthe PUC of 300,000 companies were blown up to 900,000 companies, the \noverall population estimates seem to have been overestimated (compared to \nthe previous year), thereby also raising the estimated growth rates.\nAnother factor that seems to affect the sample estimates for the companies \nfor which data are available is that the cost data obtained from the MCA \ndatabase seems incomplete and inconsistent, which seems to lead to differing \nestimates when disaggregated data is used, compared to when aggregated \ndata are used. To quote CSO:\n[T]he output as per database was restricted to the total revenue reported [which led to \nsmaller estimates].

Hence the restriction was removed and output as per database was estimated \nusing the individual components under total revenue in the database. (CSO 2015d, 87)\nThe debate on the reliability of the PCS estimates draws attention again \nto the lack of accurate estimates of the number of working companies, a \nfactor that was highlighted in the 2001 Rangarajan Commission Report. We \nreally do not know how many of the nearly one million companies registered \nwith the MCA actually produce goods and services on a reasonably regular \nbasis. Describing the size and structure of PCS, Nagaraj (2015d) argued that \na majority of the companies could be bogus, fictitious, or shell companies \nthat exist only on paper. They may not be able to produce socially useful \noutput and may simply serve the interests of their owners in camouflaging \ntheir true operations. \nIf the foregoing arguments and evidence have some value, then there is a \nserious need to re-examine the blowing-up or scaling-up procedure. Further, \ngiven the inconsistencies in the MCA database, there is a need for a thorough \nreview of the database and a cleanup before it is used to estimate the NAS. \nMoreover, the MCA 21 database needs to be made public for anyone to \nverify the official estimates.\n4.2. The Household Sector\nAs mentioned earlier, until the recent revision, the unorganized sector\u2019s \noutput was estimated indirectly as a product of the VAPW, obtained from \nnationwide sample surveys and the number of workers employed in each \nindustry. There is a long and widely held perception that the unorganized \nsector\u2019s output is invariably under-reported or escapes large-scale official \nsurveys, given the predominance of traditional or non-formal modes of \nproduction. The 2001 National Statistical Commission endorsed such a \nview. It said:\nEstimate of gross value added (GVA) per worker as per the FuS [follow-up enterprise \nsurveys] is used for the purpose of GDP calculation. Sometimes there are perceptions \nfrom the data users that the FuS estimate of GVA per worker does not reflect the reality \n(see Annex 5.17) for the estimates of GVA per worker as per the NSS 51st Round for \n1994\u201395 and the Special Enterprise Survey for 1998\u201399. In fact, the perception is that \nthe same is quite often under-estimated . Reluctance on the part of the enterprises to \nsupply correct and complete information in the surveys is one of the reasons for likely \nunder-reporting of receipts and GVA. This reluctance might be due to various reasons, \nsuch as apprehension that the information supplied may be utilised for taxation purposes \n(emphasis added).

Srinivasan 95\nThe unorganized sector, by definition, consists of innumerable small, \ntraditional, at times irregular, labor-intensive, and household enterprises, \noften representing nonmarket or premodern forms of production border-\ning on survival strategies of the disguised unemployed. The majority of \nsuch enterprises often do not (or cannot) maintain modern double entry \nbook keeping, or they cannot do so given the informal, irregular nature of \ntheir production, and the low levels of literacy of self-employed workers. \nEven granting that some small enterprises do maintain financial accounts, \nthese tend not to be kept separate from their personal or family accounts \nand therefore cannot be used for estimating value added and the profit and \nloss of such enterprises. The Indian unorganized sector largely consists of \nsubsistence activities, as opposed to modern or capitalist enterprises with \na clear separation of individual and family ownership from the legal entity \nof the company.\nIgnoring these well-received views and the above-mentioned conceptual \nproblems, the new NAS has assumed that the older methodology overesti-\nmated output per worker since it did not distinguish between different kinds \nof labor. The subcommittee that looked into the matter made the following \ncritical comments on the older methodology. To quote the report:\nThe Labour Input Method, however, suffers from inherent problems. Firstly, while \ncompiling GVAPW [gross value added per worker] ..., it is assumed that there is equal \ncontribution from all categories of workers engaged in an economic activity i.e., the \ncontribution of an employer, a wage-employee (regular or casual), or a family worker, \nis taken to be equal. Second issue is in projecting the LI [labour input] for subsequent \nyears ... The CAGR [compound average growth rate] concept based on past two rounds \nof EUS [employment unemployment surveys] being used to project the LI ends up over-\nestimating the LI for most of the compilation categories, especially in the scenario where \nthere is a drop in the LI over the next two consecutive surveys (EUS). (CSO 2015a, 6)\nTo overcome the problem, the new NAS estimated labor productivity of \ndifferent categories of workers using a nested CD production function, as \ndiscussed in Section 3 of the paper (for details see Nagaraj 2016). This has \nresulted in a contraction of LIs in the unorganized sector in the new NAS \ncompared to the old series (Figure 6).\nAs shown in Annex 1 of this paper, this production function methodology \nused for estimation is arguable. There is a need to justify the specific func-\ntional form chosen to estimate effective LI and how its results are superior \nto alternative estimates.\nAs Nagaraj (2016) has shown, there is an inconsistency between the LIM, \nwhich has contracted the contribution of self-employed labor and the large", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2903, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a711bc9a-ff1e-476b-ad17-b7900938c61d": {"__data__": {"id_": "a711bc9a-ff1e-476b-ad17-b7900938c61d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "b1-1.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\vinayak\\Downloads\\QA_based_on_pdf\\Data\\b1-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 634896, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "093ab66d-b2e1-421f-8eab-817b59ecef34", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "b1-1.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\vinayak\\Downloads\\QA_based_on_pdf\\Data\\b1-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 634896, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "44cff210b233d92c093de7d31cebf5d2f34a8626965ea4541175c4c8d73ba142", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "96 INDIA POLICY FORUM, 20 16\u201317\nsize of mixed income in the data on income distribution by factors in the \nunorganized sector.

Applying this factor to the 5.24 lakh \nactive companies that filed, the total number of companies including those \nthat did not file would be around 5.8 lakhs. \nOn the other hand, if indeed there are 13.04 lakh companies in the MCA \nrepository, and not just 5.24 lakhs that filed, using the 85 percent share of \nthe 5.24 lakh companies in the total PUC of all registered companies for \nderiving the blow-up factor, it must be the case that the companies out of the \n13.04 lakh that did not file, namely, 7.8 lakhs, with only 15 percent share", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2633, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d13f2204-4053-494b-aba7-babfb92664bd": {"__data__": {"id_": "d13f2204-4053-494b-aba7-babfb92664bd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "b1-1.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\vinayak\\Downloads\\QA_based_on_pdf\\Data\\b1-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 634896, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c299752c-4436-45be-9f75-b8d911f5188a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "b1-1.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\vinayak\\Downloads\\QA_based_on_pdf\\Data\\b1-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 634896, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "226cfe50a3fb402dba4b10a6e28622b489c73bbc3d649784e37aef7bdcf682b6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "R.

Anant, the chief statistician of India and secretary, \nMOSPI, said in an interview with Ishan Bakshi of Business Standard on \nApril 4, 2016: \nEven with the MCA data you do not get reports of all active companies that are partici-\npating. So \u2026 you make an estimate for the ones whose accounts are as yet awaited. The \npractice in national accounts has been [to] make an estimate for the whole [of all participat-\ning companies]. So you blow up or make some adjustment for the whole. (Bakshi 2016)\nWhile Dr Anant\u2019s arguments seem logical, there is a serious statistical \nproblem in applying the procedure, and the blow-up factor such as the \none used in estimating the population of a district, to the MCA data. In the \ncase of choosing a village in the sample for estimating the district popula-\ntion, the choice is random and is made by the statistician, with the village \nauthorities playing no role. On the other hand, whether a company files in \ntime, or files at all, is the company\u2019s decision. The MCA data are reported \nby companies that are self-selected. Furthermore, the 3.08 lakh companies \nthat were common to both 2012\u201313 and 2013\u201314 are also self-selected from \nthose that filed in 2012\u201313 choosing to file also in 2013\u201314. Any blow-up \nfactor that does not model self-selection, and appropriately allows for it, will \nlead to inconsistent and biased estimates, with unknown size and direction \nof bias. In particular, one cannot rule out the possibility that a company\u2019s \ndecision to report or not might depend on the contents of the report were \none to be submitted.\nThe implication of the self-selection of companies in the MCA 21 data-\nbase is that ceteris paribus comparisons of the values of GDP and its com-\nponents for 2011\u201312 in the new series\u2014based on data from self-selected \ncompanies from MCA 21\u2014with the corresponding values for the same year \nfrom the old series, would be vitiated by the self-selection bias of the new \nseries. This is likely to be of particular relevance for comparisons of total \nGDP, its industrial composition, the relative shares in GDP of the house-\nhold, and PCSs when such comparisons are made without adjusting for the \nself-selection bias of MCA 21-based estimates. Moreover, there is the fact \n22.

M EASUREMENT  OF LABOR  INPUT  AND LABOR  INCOME : PRODUCTION  FUNCTIONS\nFor the unorganized manufacturing and service sectors,23 which are part of \nthe household sector of NAS, the new series uses the concept of an \u201ceffective \nLI\u201d by defining it as a weighted sum of the LIs of owners, hired labor, and \nhelpers, using as weights their marginal productivities in value added terms \nin the base year relative to that of hired labor. It is to be noted that by this \ndefinition, different categories of labor are perfect substitutes for each other \nin production, a rather restrictive and avoidable assumption. The weights of \nthe labor categories are derived by estimating nested CD production func-\ntions for the base year for each of the relevant estimation categories/sectors. \nAs of May end 2017, the parameters of the estimated production functions, \nand in particular, the data used for non-LIs, such as capital and land, have not \nbeen released. Nor is there any information available on whether any robust-\nness checks on the empirical results were done. However, an unnumbered slide \nin CSO (2015c) lists, for eight categories of non-financial service sectors, what \nit calls conversion factors for converting a unit of owner and helper labor into \nequivalent units of hired labor. These are the production function parameters. \nIt turns out that except in education and other services, where more than one \n23. The distinction between organized and unorganized sectors, though economically \nimportant, plays only a minor role in NAS. In the annual publication of NAS, the unorgan-\nized sector is explicitly mentioned only as contributing a part of industrial value added from \nunregistered manufacturing.\nConversations and exchanges at various fora organized by CSO with their officers, sup-\nplemented by CSO (2015b), suggest that:\nIn the old series, the unorganized sector consisted of the household sector (unorganized \nsector not maintaining accounts), unorganized enterprises maintaining accounts, and nonprofit \ninstitutions serving households (NPISHs). This was nothing but a residual, negative list of \nsectors not included in the public sector or the PCS.\nIn the new series, all unincorporated enterprises that do not maintain accounts and NPISHs \nare classified as part of the household sector. Unorganized enterprises maintaining accounts \nare classified as QCs and included in PCS. \nAs noted earlier, it appears that NSS consumption expenditure has been used extensively \nin the new series for deriving implicit prices (ex-farm price) and also to work out new ratios \nfor use in estimating PFCE. Benchmark estimates for the household sector for the survey year \nare obtained from NSS surveys and are used to project relevant estimates for both enterprises \nmaintaining accounts (QCs) and not maintaining accounts (household sector).

It \nis unclear whether production functions were estimated for compilation cat-\negories or sectors other than the eight sectors. \nFor some CCs, for example, trade and repair services, \u201cwhere it was felt \nthat the productivity of different categories of labor may not have a sig-\nnificant impact on GVA, especially in the unorganized segment, the labor \ninput (LI) method was used\u201d (CSO 2015b, 10). In this case, all workers \nwere, in effect, deemed to be equally productive. Clearly, whether signifi-\ncant marginal productivity differences exist across categories of workers or \nnot is an empirical issue, given technology, that is, the production function, \nand quantities of other inputs. This being the case, there is no reason why \na production function was not estimated for all relevant CCs/sectors in the \nbase year, letting the data determine whether or not significant productiv-\nity differences exist. Comparing the average VAPW in the old series, in \nwhich all workers were assumed to be equally productive, with the weighted \naverage productivity of a workforce composed of workers with differing \nproductivities without correcting for selection bias, is inappropriate.\nThe annexures 2.3.1\u20132.3.4 of CSO (2015b) list compiling categories by \ntheir method of LI measurement. The effective LIM is used in 34 categories \nof unincorporated manufacturing in 2.3.1 and 13 categories of unincorpo-\nrated non-financial services in 2.3.3; a modified effective LI is used in 11 \ncategories of unincorporated non-financial services in 2.3.4; and finally, a \nsimple LI is used in 9 categories of unincorporated non-financial services \nin 2.3.2. For each of the 57 CCs, a production function could have been \nestimated, with the parameter values determining the weighting of the three \ncategories of labor, instead of an ex ante specification of the LIM to be used, \nas in Annexures 2.3.1\u20132.3.4. \nBeyond these problems, there are also technical issues relating to the \nparticular production function used by CSO, and whether differences in \nthe marginal productivities of different types of labor, while statistically \nsignificant in individual sectors, cancel out in the aggregate. Appendix 1 \ndiscusses these issues.\n5.1.3.

For example, \nin the CC \u201cMaintenance and repair of motor vehicles and motor cycles,\u201d \nthe indicator listed in Annex 2.5.2 for extrapolating value added at constant \nprices is, plausibly, \u201cMotor Vehicles Sales Growth.\u201d The corresponding \nindicator for extrapolating value added at current prices in Annex 2.5.1 is \n\u201cMotor Vehicles Sales Growth \u00d7 WPI.\u201d Thus, the index for extrapolating \nvalue added at constant prices is unaffected by choice of a price index for \ndeflating the value added at current prices, such as WPI, which in turn has \nnothing to do with the repair and maintenance of motor vehicles and motor \ncycles, or for that matter any service. \nThe lack of rationale for the choice of price deflators is equally strik-\ning in the case of CCs 7\u201311 relating to \u201cland transport of passengers and \nfreight.\u201d The indicator for current price value added in Annexure 2.5.1 is \n\u201cgrowth in registered vehicles \u00d7 consumer price index (CPI) (transport and \ncommunication).\u201d For constant price value added, the index is \u201cgrowth in \nregistered vehicles!\u201d Again there is no reason to expect CPI (transport and \ncommunication) to have anything to do with value added in land transport \nof passengers and freight.

I NSTITUTIONAL  SECTORS\nIn the new series, there are six \u201cinstitutional\u201d sectors comprising private \nsector financial and non-financial corporations, their two public sector \ncounterparts, general government, and a heterogeneous sector misleadingly \ncalled the \u201chousehold sector,\u201d which in effect consists of all CCs of the \neconomy other than those included in the four corporate institutions and \ngeneral government.\nIn the old series with base 2004\u201305, the \u201chousehold sector\u201d included \nwhat are called \u201cQCs.\u201d In the new series, QCs have been included under \nprivate non-financial corporations. No evidence on changes in their structure \nand inherent characteristics warranting the shift is offered. It seems to have \nbeen done for no reason except that the corporate form of organization is \nemphasized in SNA 2008. Thus, the so-called \u201chousehold sector\u201d in the \nnew NAS includes much more than conventional households consisting \nof individuals eating from the same kitchen. It includes entities such as \nNPISHs and privately owned partnerships and other noncorporate financial \nand non-financial entities. In fact, much of unorganized and unregistered \nmanufacturing, including enterprises either with no employees other than \nits owner, or with the owner and an unpaid family member as employees, \nis now part of the household sector. \nIn my view, the statistical implications of the interdependence between \nthe measurement errors and biases in estimating household incomes, con-\nsumption and investment, and in estimating corresponding statistics for the \nother five sectors have not been carefully analyzed. We refer to this issue, \nand to its treatment in CSO (2012), in Appendix 2.

P RIVATE  FINAL  CONSUMPTION  EXPENDITURE : CES AND NAS \nAn issue that has attracted attention from the late 1950s is the growing excess \nof NAS-based estimates of PFCE of households over that of the consumer \nexpenditure surveys of the NSS. As mentioned earlier, the aggregate and \ncommodity patterns of expenditure from the CES play only a limited role \nin the estimation of their corresponding values in the NAS. The volume \nedited by Angus Deaton and Valerie Kozel (2005) includes several papers \ngoing back to the late 1950s on the issue, in particular, the careful analysis \nand conclusion of Minhas ([1988] 2005). Minhas found that\nThe independent data set (NAS), it would seem fair to conclude, is far short of the touch-\nstone of quality expected of an independent validator dataset. A number of its components \nare based on such weak evidence and unverified assumptions as to seriously diminish its \nvalue in a cross validation exercise, On the other hand, the NSS estimates of expenditure \non such minor vices such as tobacco and intoxicants, and consumer durables and modern \nconsumer services are of doubtful reliability. Nevertheless, despite these difficulties, \nwhich have to be overcome in both data sets, an overwhelming proportion of household \nconsumer expenditure data of the NSS and independent private consumption estimates \nof the NAS do get cross validation. (Minhas [1988] 2005, p. 91).\nDeaton and Kozel, writing in 2005, concluded, and we agree with them \nmore than a decade later, that\n[T]he Minhas paper should be compulsory reading for anyone concerned with the issue \nof national accounts, particularly anyone who does not understand the complexities and", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2888, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f471f6cd-a3d4-41b5-a16e-d1c1417e915d": {"__data__": {"id_": "f471f6cd-a3d4-41b5-a16e-d1c1417e915d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "b1-1.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\vinayak\\Downloads\\QA_based_on_pdf\\Data\\b1-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 634896, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d445ff2f-381f-4ace-a8b5-86c4e213d55d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "b1-1.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\vinayak\\Downloads\\QA_based_on_pdf\\Data\\b1-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 634896, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "8bdc0a8860a295e423eafb8977922a85b273927076ca2b3c02efc626be99444e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "R.

R EVALIDATION  OF THE INDUSTRY  CLASSIFICATION  OF COMPANIES  IN MCA 21 \nParagraph 23 and the Annexure to CSO (2016) mention changes in both \nlevels and growth estimates of GVA that follow from the use of latest \navailable data from various (unnamed) sources and the consequent \nrevalidation of the classification of companies in the MCA 21 dataset. \nSince new data become available every year, the revalidation exercise \nhas to be an ongoing process. Furthermore, companies that have filed \nannual returns for some time may choose not to file in some years and \nnever come back or may come back after a lapse of time. It is not clear \nwhether the filed statements give any clues to a company\u2019s decision to \nstop filing or to resume filing. It would be of great help if CSO would \npublish and show how relevant NAS estimates were extracted from the \nannual statements and the procedures followed for that purpose and in \nthe revalidation exercise.\n5.1.7. C ONCLUSIONS\nThe substantial changes in the new NAS are basically two: the use of a new \ndata source, namely, MCA 21, and the production function methodology \nfor estimating LIs. In principle, both would have been indeed appropri-\nate and sensible had they been done right. It is very unfortunate that CSO \nhas not acknowledged that not strictly enforcing the mandatory filing of \ntheir annual balance sheets by companies would lead to a selection bias in \nthe NAS of unknown size and direction. Abandoning the new series and \nreturning to the old series, which by no means is free of problems, however, \nwould be inappropriate. In my view, whatever legal remedies\u2014along with \nincentives and punishments\u2014are needed to achieve full compliance with \nthe filing mandate should be adopted as soon as possible.

Comments by R. Nagaraj\nProfessor Srinivasan\u2019s views on self-selection bias in the MCA database and \nthe previously used RBI sample of companies are well known, and these \nhave also been acknowledged by the 2001 National Statistical Commission. \nIt is hard to deny the problems of selection bias. But we are faced with a \nbigger problem of not even knowing the universe of working companies to \ndraw a suitable sample. We have argued that in the absence of knowing the \nuniverse of working companies, the methods used by the new NAS to obtain \nestimates for the universe of companies in the new series have accentuated \nthe problems already present in the old series rather than solving them. The \nsolution adopted by the NAS revision seems worse than the disease, as \ndiscussed in Section 4. \nThe only way to take the debate forward and hopefully resolve it, as we \nhave jointly recommended, is by making public the MCA data and the NAS \nmethodology for using that data so that other users can independently verify \nthe official estimates.\nWe have described in Section 2 how shifting QCs from the household \nsector in the old series to PCS in the new series, and assuming them to grow \nat the same rate as corporate firms, has affected the structure of GDP. In \nSection 4, we have explained how the methodological changes (and their \nshortcomings) could have affected size and growth rates of the PCS. For \ndetails we have referred to Nagaraj (2015d). \nI agree with Professor Srinivasan that the legacy issues are very impor-\ntant. But they perhaps cannot explain the observed discrepancies in the \ngrowth rates, the changes with every revision even in the base year, and \nchanges in the structure of GDP in the new series compared to the old \nseries. These are the outcomes directly of the changed methodologies and \ndatabases used. \nTo say that the methodological changes are appropriate, but their imple-\nmentation is wrong seems as correct as saying that \u201cIndian planning was \nperfect but its implementation was wrong.\u201d I have questioned both the \nmethodological changes introduced and their implementation, whereas \nProfessor Srinivasan seems to focus only on the latter. Either way, the \nissues can be best resolved by a thorough and independent investigation \nof the entire process as well as by giving researchers full access to the \nMCA database.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2494, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c8df2159-be69-4d07-b02c-ef41e56e23e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "c8df2159-be69-4d07-b02c-ef41e56e23e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "b1-1.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\vinayak\\Downloads\\QA_based_on_pdf\\Data\\b1-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 634896, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "811dc064-c392-4813-99f6-a97733af94fb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "b1-1.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\vinayak\\Downloads\\QA_based_on_pdf\\Data\\b1-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 634896, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "216db6c8f40690a03fdd087a2a4c80fcdff60298cb4a50750d858a9e64996e3b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "R.

The Way Forward\nThe 2011\u201312 revision of the Indian national accounts has greatly altered the \nsize and composition of domestic output in the following manner:\n1. The absolute size of domestic output in the 2011\u201312 base year is \nsmaller by 3.4 percent, compared to the old series.\n2. Industry\u2019s share in GDP has expanded by about 5 percentage points, \nand the share of services or tertiary sector contracted proportionately, \nwith the agriculture sector share remaining the same.\n3. In terms of institutional composition, PCS\u2019 share has expanded by \nabout 11 percentage points, and the household or unorganized sec-\ntor\u2019s share has declined proportionately, with the public sector\u2019s share \nremaining the same. \nIf these compositional changes represented actual adjustments of the \neconomy\u2019s sub-sectors without any change in methodology, then there \nwould be no issue. However, these are apparently the result of changes \nmade in the methodologies and databases used in preparing the new NAS. \nAs many of the changes seem questionable, the compositional changes in \ndomestic output in turn become questionable, and as a result the new NAS \nestimates have been contested widely. \nAnalytically, the new NAS conceives India, except for the household \nsector and general government, as a corporate economy with the dominant, \nunorganized sector sheltering most of the labor force, the bulk of whom are \nself-employed or unpaid family labor. In the old series, the economy was \nfirst divided into the organized and the unorganized sectors, and then the \norganized sector was divided into the public sector and the PCS. The new \nNAS has narrowed the distinction between the organized and the unorgan-\nized sectors; the primary distinction now is between the corporate and the \nnoncorporate sectors, and the secondary distinction is between the financial \nand the non-financial sectors within each ownership category. \nThe methodological changes made in the new NAS are widespread, \naffecting the estimates for all sectors except the public sector and for agri-\nculture and allied activities. This is so because the institutional composition \nof NAS has changed significantly, together with the methods of estimation \nand the databases used for the purpose. The institutional sectors have not \nchanged, but their composition in terms of enterprises has. \nThe most significant change in the new NAS\u2014as the CSO admits\u2014is \nthe direct estimation of the macroeconomic aggregates for the PCS using", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2522, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6d6eda58-0d9a-462b-8f63-2f534875650e": {"__data__": {"id_": "6d6eda58-0d9a-462b-8f63-2f534875650e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "b1-1.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\vinayak\\Downloads\\QA_based_on_pdf\\Data\\b1-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 634896, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c84c8ebc-f419-4c07-af51-d1f1d7006230", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "b1-1.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\vinayak\\Downloads\\QA_based_on_pdf\\Data\\b1-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 634896, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "17d0ed53e2edb24e6bbee052aeb076512cbf36d68864100cbc2ac9ac0cf441d5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "108 INDIA POLICY FORUM, 20 16\u201317\nthe statutory filing of financial returns by corporate firms.

The new method addresses differential labour productivity by assigning \nweights to the different categories of workers engaged in an economic activity based on \ntheir productivity. The weights were compiled using data on establishments covered in the \nNSS 67th Round on Unincorporated Enterprises (ES). A nested Cobb\u2013Douglas Function \nhas been used for computing the weights for different categories of workers. (Para 2.18)\nThus, the total LI in person days is a weighted average of the person days of \nLIs of the three types, with the weight of a person day of labor of each type \nexpressed in equivalent person days of hired labor. It should be noted that \ninstead of treating different categories of labor as different inputs, CSO is \nassuming that they are perfect substitutes for each other so that total LI is a \nweighted sum of the inputs of different categories of labor.\nThe production function in natural logarithms estimated by CSO is:\nLogY Log A Log K Log L L L S=+ + + + \u23a1\u23a3 \u23a4\u23a6++\u03b2\u03b1 \u03b4 \u03b4 \u03b3 \u03b5 21 12 3 (I)\nWhere\nY is GVA\nK is the capital input \nL1 is the LI of owner (in person days per year) \nL2 is the LI of hired worker (formal and informal, in person days per year)\nL3 is the LI of helper (in person days per year)\nS is a dummy variable with rural = 0, urban = 1\nH is the random error term\nThere are many implicit assumptions in this formulation of the produc-\ntion function. First, value added by assumption is the difference between \nthe value of goods and services produced by an enterprise\u2014valued at the \n\u201cprices they fetch\u201d in the market (the enterprise is assumed to be a price \ntaker in the markets for all goods and services it produces and sells)\u2014and \nthe value of non-primary factor inputs (that is, intermediate or material \ninputs it uses in production)\u2014again valued at the \u201cprices it pays\u201d for them \n(the enterprise is assumed to be a price taker in its markets for factor and \nnonfactor inputs). Since the production function is being estimated over \nseveral periods, the question arises whether GVA is being computed at \ncurrent or constant prices. Also, since GVA is the difference between the \nvalue of outputs and the value of material inputs, if it is to be computed at \nconstant prices should the difference be deflated by the single price index, \nor should the value of outputs be deflated by an output price index and value", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2499, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9be0836d-1f1a-42d8-a217-5328ed3e926e": {"__data__": {"id_": "9be0836d-1f1a-42d8-a217-5328ed3e926e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "b1-1.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\vinayak\\Downloads\\QA_based_on_pdf\\Data\\b1-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 634896, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bddaa4cd-67e5-4c4c-bc34-849cdd62edf5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "b1-1.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\vinayak\\Downloads\\QA_based_on_pdf\\Data\\b1-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 634896, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "ae101090e1abce7190d78b1eeee36920bf26fd512a1421cfb85ccf9f1d5ed7bf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "R.

The generalization to several final outputs could be \naccomplished by viewing the enterprise\u2019s technology as one that enables it \nto produce a CES index of several final outputs from primary factors and \nmaterial inputs.\nAppendix 2: Price Deflators\nIn any national income system, the evaluation of aggregates such as GVA, \nGDP, GCF, private and government final consumption expenditure, and \ngross national income at current and constant prices, and their components \nand offshoots, is an important task. By definition, the constant price or \n\u201creal\u201d version of any aggregate is its version at current prices deflated by \nsome price deflator or price index. It is, therefore, important to assess how \nthe price indexes are put together, their strengths and weaknesses, and \ntheir ongoing improvements. Furthermore, inflation, and policies to keep it \nfrom becoming sustained and excessive, requires an appropriate index for \nmeasuring inflation. Srinivasan (2008a, 2008b) discusses many aspects of \nprice indices available as of 2008. Kumar and Boopathy (2013) update the \nfactual details in the Srinivasan paper. We would like to emphasize a few \nissues here.\nFirst, GVA at current basic prices is the difference between the value of \naggregate gross output of goods and services and the value of intermediate \nor material inputs used in production. In general, there is no physical unit \nand price for value added, so how does one deflate GVA at current prices? \nDo we deflate with a single deflator for GVA or use at least two deflators, \ndeflating the value of gross output by an output price deflator and the value \nof material inputs by an input price deflator, with the resulting difference \nbetween the two deflated values as Real GVA? Christopher Sims (1969) \nhas provided a theoretical justification for double deflation. \nHowever, in practice, CSO mostly uses single deflator, except for few \nsectors. The latest NAS manual published in 2012 on sources and methods of \nNAS applies to the old series with base 2004\u201305 (CSO 2012).

Commodity coverage has increased as well. \nHowever, two important issues relating to the wholesale price index (WPI) \nhave not been addressed yet: to introduce services into the index and to \nconvert WPI, which is neither a producer price index (PPI), nor a CPI, into \na proper PPI. Both these issues were especially emphasized on the terms of \nreference of the Abhijit Sen Committee, established in 2003, that prepared \nthe shift of the base year of WPI from 1993\u201394 to 2004\u201305. The committee \nsubmitted its report in 2008, and the base year change was implemented \nfrom April 2010. But the committee left the two issues to be addressed the \nnext time the WPI was revised (Ministry of Industry [MOI] 2010).\nThe news about the CPI is better. The base year of the National Rural, \nUrban, and Combined CPI, for example, was changed to 2012=100 from its \nprior base of 2010, along with other improvements, according to the May \n12, 2016 press release from CSO/MOSPI (CSO 2016a). \nSrinivasan (2008a, 2008b), taking his cue from the report of the Boskin \nCommission in the United States, argued that by not incorporating the \navailability of new goods and improvements in the quality of existing goods \nin a systematic and analytically appropriate way, we could be overstating \nestimated inflation rates. In India, while new goods and new versions of \nexisting goods do enter the price indices during a base year change, there is \nno systematic procedure for the introduction of new goods and new versions \nof existing goods as they become available.\nThe approach of Divisia in putting together continuous, time differenti-\nable price and quantity indices, their use in the measurement of value added \nand total factor productivity, and its growth is worth exploring, but is not \ndiscussed here for the sake of brevity.

N. Goldar \nInstitute of Economic Growth\nI think I should begin by saying that in my comments I shall try to highlight \nsome of the issues raised in the paper, and I shall offer some suggestions on \nhow the paper can be improved.\nThe paper contains a comprehensive discussion on the methodology of \nthe new national accounts series, pointing out several weaknesses of the \nmethodology and accordingly making recommendations. This is a valuable \nand welcome contribution to the literature. What are the main conclusions \nof the paper? On the question whether it is really worthwhile pursing the \nnew national accounts series, as it is at present, the authors say no. They \npoint out a number of changes that are needed, and take the position that \nmethodological changes should be made after a statistical audit. The paper \nsuggests that the principal problem lies in the use of the MCA data. \nWhy is there a problem with the MCA 21 data? The paper holds that there \nis an estimation problem caused by a process of self-selection: many more \nwell-performing companies are likely to be reporting than poorly perform-\ning ones. There are people who feel that the use of MCA 21 data is a major \nstep forward for the new national accounts series, but the authors suggest \nthat this is its worst feature. In my view, the paper should have given greater \nattention to what needs to be done rather than merely finding fault. As an \nacademic paper, a more balanced view, had it been taken, would have also \nhighlighted the improvements made in the new series.\nThis leads me to ask, can the criticism in the paper be made more useful \nand insightful? I feel there are places in the paper where this could have \nbeen done. Consider, for example, the case of trade. The growth rate in \ngross value added (GVA) in trade, repairs, hotels, and restaurants in the \nnew series was 11 percent in 2012, as against 4 percent in the earlier series. \n* To preserve the sense of the discussions at the India Policy Forum (IPF), these discus-\nsants\u2019 comments reflect the views expressed at the IPF and do not necessarily take into account \nrevisions to the conference version of the paper in response to these and other comments in \npreparing the final, revised version published in this volume.

So, \nclearly the growth rate in GVA in trade in the new series is quite high as \ncompared to the earlier series. \nTrade in India is mostly in the unorganized sector. Therefore, what is \nhappening is that there is a benchmark estimate of value added in the base \nyear that is being grown over time. In the new series, sales tax revenue is \nbeing used for this benchmarking purpose. The paper could have examined \nand contrasted the indicator used earlier with sale tax revenue that is being \nused now to grow the base year value added estimate. The question is: Is \nthe new indicator better or worse than what was being used earlier? In my \nopinion, it is probably better, but this is a topic that the paper could have \nvery usefully discussed. Is the high growth rate of GVA in trade that we are \nfinding in the new series caused essentially by the change in the indicator? \nIf so, it would have been very useful for the paper to have examined the \nindicator in depth and highlighted the limitations of using it. \nAt several places in the paper, the comment has been made that the size \nof the unorganized sector has gone down in the new national accounts as \ncompared to the earlier series, but there is really no basis for saying so. \nActually, with the data available, nobody can say if the size of the unorgan-\nized sector has declined in the new series. There are no publicly available \ndata to meaningfully compare GVA of the unorganized sector in the new \nseries with that in the old series. Let us look at this example of the estimate \nof GVA in unorganized manufacturing for 2011. \nAs also reported in the paper, the 2011\u201312 GVA estimate for manufac-\nturing in the old series for the registered portion, which is organized, was \n`886 thousand crore ( `8.86 trillion), whereas for the unorganized portion \nit was `351 thousand crore ( `3.51 trillion). The classification changed in \nthe new series. Now, it is `1,089 thousand crore ( `10.89 trillion) for the \ncorporate sector and `180 thousand crore (`1.8 trillion) for the household \nsector. Out of the unorganized manufacturing sector, units that maintain \naccounts, referred to as quasi-corporations, have been shifted out to the \ncorporate sector. The remaining unorganized manufacturing is the household \nmanufacturing sector. Hence, if one compares the figures, 351 and 180, and \ninfers that the estimate of GVA in unorganized manufacturing has gone \ndown in the new series, that is incorrect. To get a comparable estimate, we \nhave to split the GVA of the quasi-corporate segment of manufacturing \ninto both organized sector enterprises and unorganized sector enterprises. \nIn order to have comparable numbers, we have to get the GVA of the unor-\nganized component of the quasi-corporate sector and add that to the GVA", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2893, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f25e13a3-2fdc-4c60-b67e-bfcb92e8e316": {"__data__": {"id_": "f25e13a3-2fdc-4c60-b67e-bfcb92e8e316", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "48", "file_name": "b1-1.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\vinayak\\Downloads\\QA_based_on_pdf\\Data\\b1-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 634896, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ac6b582e-4006-47f6-a8db-cc62952098e6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "48", "file_name": "b1-1.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\vinayak\\Downloads\\QA_based_on_pdf\\Data\\b1-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 634896, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "79d24cc7a3b238d90ab6b95479ab8e09d2b3b06c428f203dd65b90661ea1cbb1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "120 INDIA POLICY FORUM, 20 16\u201317\nof the household sector of manufacturing.

Similarly, for 2013, the growth rate in \nmanufacturing on the basis of the IIP went up from a negative rate to posi-\ntive 6 percent when more reliable ASI data become available. The initial \nunder-estimation of manufacturing GVA growth and the correction later has \nbeen a persistent problem in the previous national accounts series, which \nhas now been solved. I thought this improvement might have got greater \nrecognition in the paper. \nThe MCA 21 database has come under a lot of criticism in the paper, \nwhich considers this to be the biggest problem in the new national accounts \nseries. The use of the MCA database really is a major change. Earlier, the \nestimates for GVA for services were being made from a small sample, \nmaybe 1,000 companies or 1,500 companies. Now the estimate of the \nservices sector GVA is being made from maybe 300,000 companies, that \nis, the number of companies being considered is huge. Let me explain \nthe problem as perceived by the authors. The problem is that at present, \na blow-up factor is being used based on paid-up capital. There are com-\npanies for which we have data, while there are other companies which \nare known to be active but for which we do not have the data. Therefore, \na blow-up factor is being used to get an estimate of GVA for the active \ncompanies for which we do not have data. The authors have suggested \nthe use of some sort of modeling for correcting the self-selection process. \nThis is a valid point. The fact that there is self-selection means that the \nblow-up factor is not correct. The important question is how the modeling \nis to be done. One suggestion is to utilize income tax data. It is a useful \nsuggestion, but is there a statistical method by which the correction for \nself-selection can be done?", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2861, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "52a28973-c195-4665-9210-bb76f4f85ca6": {"__data__": {"id_": "52a28973-c195-4665-9210-bb76f4f85ca6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "b1-1.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\vinayak\\Downloads\\QA_based_on_pdf\\Data\\b1-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 634896, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f71afed1-fcb5-426c-bb52-b074ab5c30bb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "b1-1.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\vinayak\\Downloads\\QA_based_on_pdf\\Data\\b1-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 634896, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "793fe99297c69694dd2ebe00cc5f5edfe92d277808c88bdaa536e0056a6c9b28", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "R. Nagaraj and T. N. Srinivasan 121\nI feel that the problem relating to the MCA data has been somewhat exag-\ngerated. How serious is the problem? If we assume that in the current MCA \ndata the companies that are reporting account for 85 percent of the GVA of \nall active companies, then most of the GVA is actually being covered. As \nregards the issue of using a blow-up factor of 1.15, one can argue that there \nare companies which are not reporting, and the reason for this is that they are \nnot performing well. So, this blow-up factor should not be 1.15, but lower. \nAt worst, what should it be? Suppose companies that are not reporting have \nzero GVA, then the blow up factor should be equal to one. But if we assume \nthat some companies with positive GVA are also not reporting, then maybe \na blow-up factor of 1.1 or 1.08 should be used. \nThe question is: Will that make such a big difference to the GVA num-\nbers, and the bigger issue is, why should that affect the growth rate, if the \nblow-up factor is not 1.15 but 1.08? Suppose it is 1.08 in year 1, 1.08 in \nyear 2, and 1.09 in year 3. This can affect the level of the GVA estimate, \nbut how can it affect the growth rate? This is a real issue because most of \nthe criticism of the new National Accounts series stems from the relatively \nhigher growth rate being reported in the new series. But, why should the \nuse of the blow-up factor cause a high growth rate and, in fact, why should \nit affect the growth rate at all? A related question the paper should discuss \nis: Why should the self-selection process in the MCA data always lead to \nan overestimation of the growth rate? \nOne important difference that has emerged in the new series is a shift \nfrom the establishment concept to the enterprise concept. Earlier, the manu-\nfacturing GVA estimate was based on establishment level data, and now the \nmanufacturing GVA estimate is based on enterprise level data. The current \nmethod of computing GVA in manufacturing, which is based on company \ndata, also needs to take into account the fact that a manufacturing enterprise \nmay also have establishments providing services. This point has been noted \nby the CSO. Trade carried out by manufacturing companies, which has now \nbecome a part of manufacturing GVA, was earlier covered under trade. \nThat is the reason why the relative share of manufacturing in the national \naccounts has gone up in the new series, because now a part of the services \nactivity is also getting counted under manufacturing.\nMost of the discussion in the paper concerns the years up to 2014\u201315. \nBut, if we look at 2015\u201316, we find that the manufacturing growth rate, \nwhich was earlier about 5 to 6 percent, suddenly jumped to 9 percent. Is \nthat possible? If we look at IIP growth, then the jump in the manufacturing \ngrowth rate does not seem credible. But, what about credit growth? This \naspect has been discussed in the paper.

Today, if you look around the world, there are three SNAs \nthat coexist. You have the 1968 SNA, the 1993 SNA, and the 2008 SNA. \nAround 60\u201365 percent of countries continue to be in the 1960s, they did not \nor could not move to the 1993. Most other countries, with the exception of \na handful of developed countries, are at 1993 and incidentally so are we. \nNot only are we at the 1993 SNA, but of the 1993 SNA we have actually \nincorporated only about 75 percent of the recommendations. We still have \nnot been able to incorporate 25 percent of the 1993 SNA recommenda-\ntions simply because we do not have the data. The biggest chunk of what \nis missing is that we do not have the ability to produce a balance sheet of \nthe country. So, what we produce, in terms of the sequence of accounts, is \nessentially what in accounting would be called the profit and loss account. \nSo, where does the SNA 2008 come in? Where the SNA 2008 does come \nin is in a few recommendations that change definitions, and nothing more \nthan that, and these as signatories we are all expected to do. \nGiven that this is an accounting framework driven by conventions, what \ndoes it mean to say that the national accounts should be audited? The ques-\ntion is, audited by whom? Audited by statisticians or audited by national \naccounts experts? If it is the latter, because we are talking about conventions, \nthen they have already been audited. The Central Statistics Office (CSO) has \na central team which has audited and found the accounts to be consistent with \nthe approved principles and procedures. The IMF has come in and has given \nthe accounts a clean bill of health, end of the matter. They are the custodians \nof the accounting standards, and we have all agreed to that. Now, there can \nbe and are differences of opinion, and that is something I will come to, and \nsomething that would have been useful for the paper to have talked about, \nbecause in my opinion that is where the fundamental issues are.\nWhere are really the problems? There has been a lot of talk about GDP \nshares shifting around, growth rates shifting around. All that is fine, if that \nis what the data is saying, that is what you get. But what is in the data that is \nreally different has been discussed briefly in the paper, too briefly, and even \nthen it really does not touch upon the fundamentals. The real issue is the \nfollowing. What this particular revision of the national accounts has done is \nthat it has moved a whole bunch of sectors from following a physical output \napproach to measurement to a value approach. Think of the Annual Survey \nof Industries (ASI). The ASI is one of the most comprehensive datasets. \nYou can not only directly measure value added from that, but you can also \nmeasure the volume of output.

Earlier, the way we were measuring the growth \nof the trade sector was to use the output of traded goods, not services, but \ntraded goods. Now we are measuring it by the sales tax, which is a value \nadded tax, so again we are measuring values. \nThe real question that we need to ask is: If we are shifting from measuring \nphysical output to measuring values, how should we do the deflation, and \nare we doing it appropriately? The short answer is: No, we are not doing it \nappropriately. But the longer answer is that we are not sure about the type \nof deflation we should do. There is talk in the paper about single deflation \nand double deflation. But this raises the question, and this is an issue that the \nIMF also brought up in their audit of the revised series, whether we are clear \nabout what the two approaches mean. Think of what we do, and we have \nbeen doing since the accounts began\u2014I am surprised Professor Srinivasan \ndid not point this out as a legacy issue\u2014we have been doing single defla-\ntion all along, and we continue to do so. The question to ask is: While doing \nsingle deflation for the new series, are we making matters worse than they \nwere before? There is actually a very strong case to be made for saying yes, \nwe may be making matters worse. Earlier, at least for a whole bunch of sec-\ntors, we had physical indicators, and today when we have moved to values, \na wrong deflation approach is making matters worse. That is a legitimate \ncriticism. But as economists, we really need to ask ourselves what double \ndeflation means. This is something I have been searching for in the literature. \nAnd I have never found a suitable explanation. \nBut think of it in the following manner. As the paper rightly says, there are \nthree ways to measure GDP: the production approach, the income approach, \nand the expenditure approach. Presumably, we should use different deflators \nfor each approach. Or, should we not? At the end of the day, it is the funds \nflow that matters. These three approaches should equate in nominal terms, \nthen what do we mean by real income? As a consumer or as a spender, real \nincome means what it buys for me in terms of consumer goods or investment \ngoods. But, for a producer, what does double deflation mean? Mechanically, \nI take the product price and deflate the output value, and I take the input \nprice and deflate the input values, and whatever I get as a residual, I say it \nis real value added. But when I say real, what is that animal? Why should it \nnecessarily equal real GDP measured from the expenditure side? \nUnless as economists we are very clear about how we should deflate \nnominal values, we will be tying ourselves into knots.

She suggested that it may be possible to match the \nMCA 21 returns of firms with their Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) data, \nwhich has been available at the plant level for a long time without identi-\nfiers and which the firms may also be willing to provide. If we can have \naccess to both sets of data, we could iteratively match firms up until we got \na reasonable fit, and this would then help resolve the differences between \nthe two datasets and what they were telling us about manufacturing growth. \nShe noted that the National Accounts Statistics (NAS) is both a system of \naccounts and a powerful tool to measure growth and change in the structure \nof the economy, and there was a strong need to understand why the same \nmanufacturing sector appeared to be behaving in very different ways as \nmeasured by the old NAS series and the new one.\nSurjit Bhalla suggested that it would be very useful for this paper, or \na new paper, to document and analyze the academic criticism of the new \nNAS series, as distinguished from the critiques of investment bankers or the \nmedia. Second, Bhalla suggested that base revisions in GDP series do result \nin anomalies, and we should not get too exercised about few percentage \npoint differences. He recalled that previous base revisions had also thrown \nup differences between the old and the new series, differences possibly much \nbigger than what the current revision was showing. He particularly recalled \nthe base revision of 1993\u201394 where the change may have been as much as \n25 percent. Third, Bhalla noted the genuine improvements in things like \nmeasuring wholesale and retail trade, which has moved from an archaic \napproach to one based on the analysis of sales tax data.

After revision, IIP and ASI move \ntogether in unison for 4 to 5 years, and then the IIP base becomes out of \ndate and they start diverging. He finally turned to the fragilities of the MCA \ndata. Even the data for the companies which were reporting had problems, \nand it would appear that CSO had not done the preparatory work required \nto make the data fully useable. \nVijay Joshi pointed out that as a consumer of the data what was trou-\nbling was that the rapid GDP growth suggested by the new series was \nnot matching up with other high frequency data. How does one explain a \nvigorously growing economy at 7 percent per year and a negative growth \nrate of non-oil imports? \nSudipto Mundle also found the discussion very useful, but was also \ntroubled by how polarized it was. This made it difficult to figure out a way \nforward out of the controversy around the new GDP series. To the authors, \nhe asked the question of why growth rates should be affected so much even \nif we assume all the problems with the new series that have been highlighted \nare present, since they would affect both the base year and a measurement \nyear. From Goldar and Sen, the discussants, he wanted to know if it would \nbe possible to get the back numbers for the new series so that the compari-\nsons between the old and the new series could be gone into greater detail. \nThis would help greatly in reducing the apprehensions around the new \nseries, particularly the disconnect with the high frequency economic data", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2813, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "03b82166-663d-44f4-b7db-1c2371203caf": {"__data__": {"id_": "03b82166-663d-44f4-b7db-1c2371203caf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "b1-1.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\vinayak\\Downloads\\QA_based_on_pdf\\Data\\b1-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 634896, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c1b94916-aff4-4d31-b865-7cf4c27643b5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "b1-1.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\vinayak\\Downloads\\QA_based_on_pdf\\Data\\b1-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 634896, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "d8b640f53964890425f54490fb4f0508426c460d453d3717fd0443d91273cfd0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "R.

Finally, Mundle wanted to know if \nthe sharp divergence between WPI inflation, which had fallen dramatically \nas of July 2017 and had actually turned negative, and CPI inflation, which \nwas higher and had continued to remain positive, meant that the share of \ndomestic trade was going up sharply in recent years.\nT. N. Srinivasan noted that their paper did deal with the divergence \nbetween WPI and CPI, and he was himself concerned about the impact \nof this divergence on the GDP deflator. He felt that issues such as this \ndeserved much more attention than simply introducing the MCA 21 data-\nbase. R. Nagaraj noted that with the number of companies submitting data \nin the MCA database jumping around from year to year, the blow-up factor \nalso had to change from year to year. So the levels would be differentially \naffected from year to year, and it is not as simple as saying that even if there \nare errors in calculating levels, those errors would apply to all years and \nhence growth would not be affected. Growth will be affected if the meth-\nodology is affecting levels differently in different years. He also supported \nthe concern voiced by Vijay Joshi about the disconnect between the faster \ngrowth shown by the new series and other data such as the import numbers.\nBishwanath Goldar acknowledged that the point made in the paper \nemphasizing the need to address the problem of self-selection in the MCA \ndatabase was very appropriate. But he said that it was not clear what econo-\nmetric technique should be deployed to obtain the adjustment for self-selec-\ntion bias. He also felt that ultimately any adjustment would manifest itself \nin a smaller or larger blow-up factor, and the adjustment would be unlikely \nto fluctuate much from year to year and would not, therefore, make a big \ndifference on growth. Similarly, even assuming that the MCA database had \na lot of errors, it was difficult to believe that these errors would consistently \nonly push up the growth rate every year, as seems to have happened with the \nGDP growth higher for four years under the new series. What is instead more \ncredible is that there has been genuine growth. The other point he noted was \nthat not all manufacturing firms were registered under the ASI. However, \nit is very likely that these firms would be covered by the Companies Act \nand would therefore have data in the MCA database. So there are problems \nwith the ASI numbers as well, and it would not be fair to say that ASI was \nalways more accurate and represented the real picture, and MCA 21 did \nnot. Both have problems.\nPronab Sen responded to the concern expressed by Vijay Joshi about \nhow to square the higher growth numbers with other macro-data that were \nnot showing the same vibrancy.
